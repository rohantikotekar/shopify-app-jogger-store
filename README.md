# Shopify App by Rohan 

This project is a modern e-commerce store focused on selling joggers, built using Shopify 2.0 and the Remix framework. Leveraging the power of the Dawn theme, the store delivers a responsive and customizable shopping experience. Both Storefront and Admin APIs from Shopify were integrated to enable dynamic product handling, order management, and seamless user interactions. Data is saved dynamically with proper GET and POST request handling, thoroughly tested using Postman for reliable API performance.

Aslo worked on Shopify theme development using the Dawn theme as a foundation and Liquid as the primary templating language. The front-end was built with responsive design principles, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices. Various sections and blocks were customized and added to enhance flexibility for merchants, including dynamic product displays, promotional banners, and customer testimonials.
